# stat-tracker

Stat-tracker exists because I am too cheap to buy a new watch.

There's an app known as [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/) which is an app you can use to track your miles, if you own a garmin running watch. I'm sure the team at Garmin has made a wonderful app; however: 

I am too cheap to buy a Garmin watch.

Enter stat-tracker - the powerful new app written in python using the django framework.

## Project spec:

```
Stat tracker will be a web app that allows users to view their running progress over time based on data collected by a running watch, as well as enabling users to add runs manually.

Once users are logged in, they will be able to view their run history, see graphs on stats like splits, distance, and speed, etc. over time.
```

## Requirements:

- Authentication
- Graph display - "My History" section
- Create, Edit, Delete operations for runs
- Deployed to server
