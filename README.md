# stat-tracker

Stat-tracker exists because I am too cheap to buy a new watch.

There's an app known as [Garmin Connect](https://connect.garmin.com/) which is an app you can use to track your miles, if you own a garmin running watch. I'm sure the team at Garmin has made a wonderful app; however: 

I am too cheap to buy a Garmin watch.

Enter stat-tracker - the powerful new app written in python using [django](https://www.djangoproject.com/).

## Project spec:

```
Stat tracker will be a web app that allows users to view their running progress over time.

Thw information will be built from data collected by a running watch, users will have the ability to add runs manually or upload a file for parsing.

Once users are logged in, they will be able to view their run history, see graphs on stats like splits, distance, and speed, etc. over time.
```

## Requirements:

- Authentication
- Graph display - "My History" section
- Create, Edit, Delete operations for runs
