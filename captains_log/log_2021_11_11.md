# log_2021_11_11

Initialized the project today. Glad I finally got some traction going, feels like this idea has been kicking around forever.

Things I did today include:
- Initializing the git repository
- Initializing the django project
- Adding the virtual environment
- Initializing the database

We're gonna keep it simple with the db since our focus is more on creating a full CRUD application with user authentication.

Speaking of, I'd like to take a moment to mull over where we're going next. We'll need to build our models. // plug MVC pattern

Let's think about what we need to track. For each run, I would like to know distance, average speed, steps, calories burned, and the date.

These are all things that my garmin forerunner 35 tracks, as well as the splits (which we'll get into in a second).

However, since my garmin is the cheapest watch, it doesn't retain any information past 2 weeks. Pour one out for the lost data :'(

Anyways the second thing we'll want to track is the mile splits for each run. That is, the actual mile times from each run.

It should look something like this

```
run:
  run_id:          INT    NOT_NULL
  date:            DATE   NOT_NULL
  average_speed:   INT
  distance:        FLOAT
  steps:           INT
  calories_burned: INT
```

and

```
splits:
  split_id:        INT    NOT_NULL
  full_mile:       BOOL
  date:            DATE
  run:             FOREIGN KEY
```
