# Back in the saddle again, again, again

Hoo boy is it good to be back! Looks like we're looking at another half marathon season. Currently, it is January 2025, and I am looking at running the Cap City Half at the end of April.

It will be a challenge! I haven't run a whole lot since running the half last year. I've been getting into weightlifting instead.

It would be cool to be able to track lifts in the same way I'm tracking runs. Something to look into further.

However, what I've just done will be applicable to both. I've created a Schedule class that will track the start and end date of an engagement (think a training program) and will be linked to runs that the user inputs.

The long term goal is to track progress of exercises over time, over multiple training cycles too. That is to say, how does my marthon training and performance compare to how it was last year? How many calories did I burn during the whole training cycle? How many miles did I run total? How am I progressing on my current training?

I should be able to mark and track my progress on a schedule (training program) with the click of a button.

The problem is, how to I create future runs, and get the user to tell me more about their stats when they achieve their goals.

Also how do I differentiate between past runs and future runs.


# TODO:
- ~~Achieve full CRUD functionality using formsets~~
- Give user preference of miles or kilometers - TBD this is 'murica
- Implement conversion of miles to kilometers
- Create designs for 'my Runs' page - needs doin' still
- ~~Add carousel (in progress)~~ - a little janky but it works
- Better design for 'add Run' page - who needs designs? not me
