Back in the saddle again. It's been a minute. I've actually completed the half
that I originally set out to track my progress for. Dangling proposition! I
don't care.

I ended up catching COVID on NYE and was not able to train for a week and spent
the next week recovering and before I knew it, it was time to run the race.
Ended up with a 2:06, tantalizingly close to my original goal of a sub 2 hour
race. But going into a race without training for two weeks and being slightly
hungover will do that I suppose. Anyways, I'm glad I went through with it.

Still plan on running, might sign up for another half this summer. Who knows,
it could give me a chance to actually track my miles this time.

As far as the project goes, my most recent additions enabled javascript on the
project; however I don't think it will have solved my problem of dynamically
adding form fields on the page. It looks like there is a FormSet feature of
django which enables users to add fields dynamically which I'll look into next.

TODO:
- Research FormSets
- Implement FormSets for adding splits
