The stars have aligned once again, for I will be running a half marathon this
April, the 29th. I finally got back into it today (just a mile or so, mind you)
and I'm feeling good about the lead up to this race.

I have 11 weeks from this weekend to train up for the big 13.1. If I can hit
two miles for my long run this weekend, I'm on a good track to keep tacking a
mile on each week, culminating in 13 on the 29th.

Anyways, I was inspired to take up this project again because the
perseverance required to finish out a software project is similar to the
perseverance required to finish out a half marathon.

It's all about <ins>momentum</ins>.

When you're training for a run, you set your sights on a clear goal, with a clear
deadline. So you follow a training schedule for the days and months leading up
to the deadline. Assuming you're starting from nothing (0 miles) you can start
training 3 months out from the race and be just fine the day of.

Why is that? You can start off day one as a couch potato but if you even get up
and walk around the park, that's a win. You showed up. The hardest part is
always the first step. Whether it's at the park, on a treadmill, at the track
at the gym, put on your trusty ol' running shoes and just run as far as possible.

First, you have to put yourself out there. But showing up consistently matters.
The next run is a bit easier, and then you come back the next day and run a
little farther. Then you show up again the next day, and you find it's easier
to run that mile. Then 2 miles. And so on and so forth.

Eventually, after multiple commits over time, your body gets leaner (assuming
you're in a calorie deficit over time). You burn fat and you build muscle.

### The same can be said of a codebase.

Initially, you have an idea and you say 'let me see if I can get it to work'.
So you initialize a new project, write some lines of code that you copied from
stack overflow, and pass it off as your own. The site, project, or otherwise
world saving app is a little clunky at first, but it runs.

When you finally get a clear picture of project requirements, you go to work
day after day, abstracting logic into components, separating responsibilities
into principles, and refactoring old code while adding new features until it has
fulfilled it's requirements.

Eventually, after multiple runs, your codebase gets leaner (assuming you're
refactoring over time). You remove unecessary code and add new features.

In both scenarios you're compounding your efforts by doing them consistently
over time and in a dedicated direction, thus building momentum. Whether your
goal is a 13 mile run or a fully functional CRUD Django application, when you
show up it gets easier the next time.

Anyways, with all that being said I think it's time to kick the rust off this
bucket and bring it back to life.

# TODO:

 - Achieve full CRUD functionality using formsets - need delete functionality

 - ~~Add JavaScript to dynamically add forms~~ - not necessary due to formset

 - Style the site for a pleasant user experience - design run page
