# Back in the saddle again, again

It would be cool to automatically calculate the speed for a run in miles per hour (or kilometers per hour) based
on the distance and time itself. This could be done on the frontend quite easily, will just need to add some javascript 
to the add run page.

Another idea is to include the conversion from miles -> kilometers and vice versa. Perhaps a user preference option saying 
their preferred distance measurement.

Anyways the formula for calculating speed should be relatively straightforward. Speed = distance/time so I would probably just 
have to remember the conversion rates. Oh boy, here we go.

So if we have 22 minute and 56 second run, at a distance of 2.1 miles, we can convert it into seconds by multiplying 22 minutes 
by 60 to get 1320 seconds (check my math on that) then we would add 56 seconds remaining to get 1376 seconds total. 

Dividing that by 60 to get minutes, then dividing it again by 60 to get hours we get .382 (repeating) hours.

So now we have our time in hours, we can convert to miles per hour by dividing by the # of miles run.

In this case, .3822222222222 hrs / 2.1 miles â‰ˆ 5.5 miles/hour.

Nice. All that's left is to implement it in JS
