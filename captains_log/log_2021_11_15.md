I thought of another problem to solve. So I'm missing data because I started
this project late right? There is no way to solve for the missing data. Though
that's not entirely true. I still have my records from the initial
db I created when trying to figure out the Entity Relationship Diagram. So if I
have an approximate idea of when I was starting and how many miles I was
running at each run, I have a baseline to perform some sort of statistical
analysis. I'll have to do more research into what it is I'm looking to do, but
I think what I'm thinking of is called linear regression.

Which, interestingly enough, could be used to forecast future runs. Using this
I might be able to create some sort of function that recommends a running
schedule based on a baseline set of stats.

Anyways that's a problem for future Noah to solve. Right now I've got to create
my views and templates for Run and Split.
